    <h1>Blog G</h1>
    <p>You know, I've never written blogs before. I don't keep a diary or anything either. I have a journal, but its
        really just filled with monthly budgets and stuff like that. The actual process of sitting down and writing
        about my thoughts is... not exactly new, but a bit strange to me.</p>
    <p>When I was a kid I was always paranoid about keeping a diary. My mom and older sister are the nosiest people I've
        ever met, and I was sure they'd read my diary if yhey got a chance. I used to toy with the idea of writing in
        code but even then I had a lazy streak in me. Lots of kids wrote stuff in code sometimes but it seemed tedious.

    <p>Hmmm anyway let me rant a little.</p>
    <p>I got insurance for my new car around 2 weeks ago. Today I called them to ask some questions, and the lady
        casually asked me what my home owners insurance was. I was like?? I don't own a house. And she goes "Oops looks
        like we signed you up as a home owner and you got a discount for that, you next payments will be higher from now
        on". Like excuse me? Why did they sign me up for a discount in the first place? The only reason why I got a
        quote from them was because it was a good price. Now theyr'e gonna make it higher? How is it my fault that they
        made that mistake? They shoulve mentiooened that I;'d be getting a discount and I wouldve set them straight, but
        noooo, they just give me a quote and then change it after a few weeks.</p>
    <p>I feel scammed. I wonder if they usually pull that bs on customers to make them sign up for a quote.</p> -->
