    <h1 id="page_title">Hi guys :) This blog is part 2 of practicing for my project</h1>
    <!-- <div id="side_left_div" class="dots"></div>

    <main>
        <p class="text has_margin">This time I want to focus on using JavaScript libraries to bring my website to life.
            Like I said before, I want ALOT of animation. My aim is to toe the fine line between a cool website and a
            tacky one. </p>
        <p class="text has_margin">This blog is for trying out javascript libraries. I can’t belive I’ve been doing
            frontend for a while now and only stuck to HTML and CSS because I was too scared to try Javascript. I’m
            thinking about so many missed opportunities now :(</p>
        <p class="text has_margin">Well, better late than never. I also failed miserably last blog on the show/hide
            sections with JQuery so I’m gonna try that again. </p>
        <div class="jqueryDiv has_margin" id="top">
            <h1 class="form_section purple_title">Ok, click this block</h1>
            <div id="hide_this1">
                <p class="purple_text">If it worked correctly, you should be able to view these words and the other two
                    blocks should’ve disappeared. Yay! </p>
                <p class="purple_text">If it didn’t ... *sigh* ... back to the drawing board.</p>
            </div>

        </div>
        <div class="jqueryDiv has_margin" id="middle">
            <h1 class="form_section purple_title">Or this one</h1>
            <div id="hide_this1">
                <p class="purple_text">I feel like I spent WAY too long on this functionality. In the end it was very
                    simple,
                    straightforward code. But it took me so long to find it. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="jqueryDiv has_margin" id="bottom">
            <h1 class="form_section purple_title">Even this one should work</h1>
            <div id="hide_this1">
                <p class="purple_text">The next part is going to be trying to use JavaScript libraries to create amazing
                    animations.
                    I am actually kind of terrified, and I think I'm biting off WAY more than I can chew. </p>
                <p class="purple_text">But it is so integral to my project idea that I should be able to use that
                    functionality.
                    Wish me luck!
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text has_margin">As you will see, I’m trying to keep JavaScript animations contained in certain
            sections. I suppose I should've begun my project by now but I wanted to get everything *perfect* before I
            started it. No, 'm not a perfectionist but I want to know what is possible before starting. </p>
        <form id="form" class=" has_margin">
            <h1 class="purple_title">Ok for the final part: </h1>
            <p class="purple_text has">This part simulates sending me an email. I found a JS service that lets you do
                it, but
                it's paid and I don't know if I need that functionality right now.

            <h1 class="purple_title">Another form</h1>
            <p class="purple_text has">I want the form section to have JS animations, using P5.js, and I'm not sure
                I can pull it off. So I'm gonna try it out here.
