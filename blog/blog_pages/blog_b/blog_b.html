            <h3>Hi</h3>
            <p>Can you read this?</p>
            <p>Tom, do you think its working?</p>
            <h2>Hello?</h2>
            <p>We dont have much time, so I'll just hope you can read this.</p>
            <p>We found the Voyager Golden Records.</p>

    <p>I got that message this morning from a friend. </p>
    <p>We humans always make the worst choices. On the other hand, we did invent custard stuffed donuts. Have some while
        I tell you about my week, and together we can ignore our impending doom.</p>

    <p>My class assignments are piling up. How can I already have a midterm next week? I'm pretty certain we were
        introducing ourselves just yesterday. Most of my classes are group work projects. I am <b>NOT</b> a fan of group
        work. That being said, the assignments are too much for 1 to handle so I should just live with it.</p>

    <p>I still feel sick after watching the GIF of drone killings we saw in this weeks discussion. I am actively trying not to think of it because I dont want to break down in the library.</p>

    <p>Speaking of libraries, Thompson is open again! Currently enjoying the atmosphere of the Great Reading Room

    Everything is fine.

            Records</a>. Why we ever sent them out I'll never know.</p>
