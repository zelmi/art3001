    <h1>What A Week</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I've been spending so much time on my project 1. I kind of regret all the animations and stuff I decided to put
        in because they’re making the process significantly more difficult.</p>
    <p>I've had a midterm today and it went much better than I expected! I'm really glad because I cant pretend I've
        studied much for it. My car crashed like 2 weeks ago and I've been spending a lot of time searching for and
        buying a car.</p>
    <p>I've also applied for graduation this week. I still cant believe I have just 1 more semester to go. I feel like
        Im gonna fail in one of my last classes and Im going to have to add a whole other semester. I'm genuinely
        terrified.</p>
    <p>On the bright side I also got my taxes done this week. It’s a bit early but I need the cash because this new car
        really put a dent in my savings. My (not so) little brother did his taxes for the first time this year. He only
        worked for like 3 weeks the whole of last year and expected to get a lot of money back lol, I feel a bit bad for
        him. But it was also kind of hilarious.</p>
    <p>So thats all! I'm gonna get back to working on this project and trying to make P5.js work for me. I just can't
        get it to work with multiple p5 canvases in 1 HTML file no matter which tutorials I follow. </p>
    <p>Goodbye! Enjoy this gorgeous cat photo I saw and stole from Twitter the other day. Just look at those eyes!!!</p>
