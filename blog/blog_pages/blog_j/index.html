    <h2 class="text">CSS Animation!</h2>
    <p class="text"> Most of the animations I've been using in my site were just things I copied and pasted from codepen and other
        places and fiddled with.</p>
    <p class="text">But I've become so interested that I just had to learn how to do these things on my own, so I started a CSS
        animations course on <a href="https://www.Lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a>. I want to learn really advanced stuff. </p>

    <p class="text">CSS animations is my latest effort at finding an artistic way of expression. I've tried about a million things by now, a million artistic outlets to tell stories or express things, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">none of them worked</span> I didn't stick around long enough to get good at any of them. Here are a few things I've tried:</p>
    <p>1. Drawing: My drawings never turn out the way I intend them to. I'll set out to draw something beautiful and it always turns out looking unintentionally weird. Here is a picture I drew once. I was trying to get fairies.</p>

    <p class="text">Like seriously lmao wtf is that.</p>
    <p class="text">2. Painting: Painting is just not my thing. I mean its super fun and I love to do it, but I dont paint any thing real. If I marketed myself well though I could become the leading abstract artist of our age LMAO.</p>
    <p class="text">3. Animation: I cannot bring myslef to put in the energy and effort to learn actual animation. I watched a youtube tutorial once called "Animation for Beginners!"... I got tired just thinking about all that work.</p>
    <p class="text">Other things I've dabbled in include photo manipulation (which I havent given up on yet), writing and storytelling. Nope (so far), nope and yes... if it's telling the stories to kids. I can actually make up really good stories and can tell them really well to kids but that's as far as it goes. </p>
    <p class="text">So now its CSS animation. I think I need to stop "dabbling" and actually stick to one thing for a long time, but I always get distracted by a new idea. I'm determined to see this Lynda course through though.</p>
    <p class="text">ps: I did not draw any of the doodles on this page except the lovely fairies.</p>
