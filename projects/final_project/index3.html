        <p id="main-text">And then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the
            watchers
            rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach
            him
            were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts
            that
            deafened him.</p>
        <p id="secondText">Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley
            and
            McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not tell whose
            hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of
            them
            determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last.</p>
