        <p class="text" id="text1">The battle of Hogwarts takes place on the 7th year of Harry Potter’s entry to the
            legendary castle-school. The
            battle has been ranging all night between the forces of darkness and the remnants of light. Innumerable
            deaths
            have taken place, and bodies are strewn upon the floor. </p>
        <p class="text" id="text2">In an attempt to capture Harry Potter without difficulty, Lord Voldemort promises to
            end the battle and spare all
            if Harry gives himself up for capture. Harry does so (without letting any of his supporters know) , as
            Voldemort knew he would, and for the second time in Harry’s life, he is hit directly with a Killing Curse
            from
            Lord Voldemort’s hand.</p>
        <p class="text" id="text3">And for the second time, Harry does not die.</p>
